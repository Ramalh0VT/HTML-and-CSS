# Main description
This is a repository so i can enhance and save my HTML/CSS projects and learn more about it. You will find here websites varying from very simple websites to very complex and functional ones! 
    
## html folder
This is the folder where i started to learn html again, remembering alot of stuff i forgot. Here you will mostly find simple websites, but some more complex stuff may appear.

## css folder
Here things get more complex than on the basic html folder, this is where i save more complex things

## final project folder
While this is likely not the final thing i will be developing in this repo, it is the project i will invest the biggest amount of time in to learn what i still have to learn about html and css. This project will have multiple pages and i will use all my creativity to make it look nice and genuine.                

## Quick note
Just like my python repo, once i learn all the necessary concepts to start developing my own things i will stop investing time into this repository, and then i will invest time on learning about databases and SQL, after that i will start investing time into my flask repository again.
